# VSCode Liquid Snippets

A collection of Visual Studio Code snippets for the Liquid Templating language. Some of these snippets are specific to Shopify and may not apply to other platforms that use Liquid.

## Installing
Installation is fairly simple. In your Visual Studio Code editor, visit the Extensions: Marketplace and look up "vscode-liquid-snippets". Click install and restart your editor once it has completed downloading. From there, you will be able to access these snippets from within any .liquid files.
